The parties had clearly understood that the amount claimed by EIL was on account of liquidated damages, as stipulated in clause 12 of the GPC. The parties having clearly understood that the amount claimed by EIL was on account of liquidated damages, it was incumbent on EIL to aver and prove that it had suffered a loss.

        "Extracts of discussion": "45. We are, therefore, of the view that neither was the fundamental basis of the contract dislodged nor was any frustrating event, except for a rise in the price of coal, excluded by clause 12.4, pointed out. Alternative modes of performance were available, albeit at a higher price. This does not lead to the contract, as a whole, being frustrated. Consequently, we are of the view that neither clause 12.3 nor 12.7, referable to Section 32 of the Contract Act, will apply so as to enable the grant of compensatory tariff to the respondents. Dr. Singhvi, however, argued that even if clause 12 is held inapplicable, the law laid down on frustration under Section 56 will apply so as to give the respondents the necessary relief on the ground of force majeure. Having once held that clause 12.4 applies as a result of which rise in the price of fuel cannot be regarded as a force majeure event contractually, it is difficult to appreciate a submission that in the alternative Section 56 will apply. As has been held in particular, in the Satyabrata Ghose case, when a contract contains a force majeure clause which on construction by the Court is held attracted to the facts of the case, Section 56 can have no application. On this short ground, this alternative submission stands disposed of. ",

        "Extracts of discussion": "8.9 In view of these facts and anticipated slippage in the COD, the Appellants\napprised the first Respondent of the same and requested for extension of COD by six\nmonths as admissible under the PPA. It is not in dispute that the total completion\nperiod of 18 months from the effective date was provided considering all the activities\nincluding various approvals, procurement of equipment, installation and\ncommissioning and final safety clearance from Chief Electrical Inspector for charging\nthe line etc.. However, in receiving approvals from Govt. instrumentalities for land\nconversion, evacuation arrangement, safety clearances etc., the Appellants not only\nfaced severe difficulties but also considerable delay of 7-8 months. The Appellants\naccordingly put forward the case to Govt.\nof Karnataka as well as first Respondent for COD extension by six months which after due diligence\nand prudence, the Govt./first Respondent acceded to. Before further evaluation of the rival\ncontentions of the parties regarding the extension of time, we take note of various clauses of PPA\nspecially Clause 2.5 which is reproduced below:-\n\"2.5 Extensions of Time 2.5.1 In the event that the SPD is prevented from performing\nobligations under Clause 4.1 by the Scheduled Commissioning Date due to:\na) Any BESCOM Event of Default; or\n(b)Force Majeure Events affecting BESCOM; or\n(c) Force Majeure Events affecting the SPD.\n2.5.3 In case of extension occurring due to reasons specified in clause 2.5.1(a), any of the dates\nspecified therein can be extended, subject to the condition that the Scheduled Commissioning Date\nwould not be extended by more than 6 (six) months.\n2.5.6 As a result of such extension, the Scheduled Commissioning Date and the Expiry Date newly\ndetermined date shall be deemed to be the Scheduled Commissioning Date and the Expiry Date for\nthe purposes of this Agreement.\"\nChennamangathihalli Solar Power ... vs Bangalore Electricity Supply Company ... on 14 September, 2020\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/79070363/ 34\nIt is evident from the above that due to reasons specified in Clause 2.5.1(a), Scheduled\nCommissioning Date could be extended up to six months and as a result of such extension, the\nnewly determined COD and expiry date shall be deemed to be the scheduled COD and the expiry\ndate for the purpose of this agreement. 8.10 Regarding force majeure events, Clause 8.3 of PPA, it is\nnoted that under sub-clause (vi), it is provided that \"inability despite complying with all legal\nrequirements to obtain, renew or maintain required licenses or legal approvals\" will also attribute to\nforce majeure. In view of these provisions under the PPA, we are of the opinion that the delay in\nreceiving various approvals / clearances by the Govt. and its instrumentalities which were beyond\nthe control of the Appellants should also be treated as an event of force majeure under sub-clause\n(vi) of clause 8.3 which has directly and severely affected the execution of the solar projects. To be\nmore specific, if the approval for land conversion is received on last day of September, 2016, it\nbecomes extremely difficult to achieve COD on 03.01.2017 as envisaged under the PPA. Moreover,\nthe grant of extension of the Scheduled COD was accorded by Govt. of Karnataka and in turn, by\nfirst Respondent after complying with due procedures and applying its diligence and prudence\nunder the four corners of the PPA and not beyond.\n",

        "Extracts of discussion": " 10. A careful perusal of the above discussed clauses of the Agreement\nmanifests that the assessee was granted the use of know-how by GKN Automotive GmbH, Germany;\nthe assessee admitted the Licensor as the owner of proprietary rights in the know-how; the assessee\nwas prevented from disclosing such know-how to others; the assessee could not assign it to others;\nand at the termination of the Agreement, the assessee could not use the know-how provided to it.\nWhen we consider the nature of payment for use of technical know-how made during the year,\nwhich is @ 3% of the selling price for the 'use of technical know-how', there remains no doubt that\nthis payment is in the nature of a revenue expenditure.\n\n\n\nThus, it is apparent that the assessee-Licensee can terminate the Agreement, under all the sub-clauses of Clause 13.1 of the Agreement, either due to some default or incapacity of the\nLicensor or Government order. All these situations make it crystal clear that the Licensee cannot, at his own sweet will, terminate the Agreement and, thereafter, continue to use the know-how received\nfrom Licensor free of charge. Such a right to terminate the Agreement vests in the Licensee only if the default is committed by the Licensor. The Licensee, under no circumstance, can suo motu terminate the Agreement without any default by the Licensor and also reap the benefits of free user\nof technical know-how. Ergo, Clause 14.1 of the Agreement, which has been greatly harped on by the\nld. DR, does not defend the case of the Revenue because the assessee cannot, at its pleasure,\nterminate the Agreement and use the technical know-how without any consideration. When we consider the effect of termination of the Agreement in totality, what emerges is that the Licensee, on such termination, shall be bound to return the know-how acquired from the Licensor, which remains his exclusive property.\n\nHence, the amount so paid is eligible for deduction as a revenue expenditure. We, therefore, overturn the assessment order on this point and allow deduction of the\namount paid for the use of technical know-how",

This Court finds itself in respectful agreement with the judgements, which have been upheld and\nquoted with approval even as recently as in 2012.20 The appropriate interpretation, which appeals\nto business common sense, in matters involving such ostensibly contradictory clauses, would be to -\nunless a clear intention to the contrary appears from the agreement - regard the parties as having\nagreed to refer disputes to arbitration, and having agreed to a particular court as having supervisory\njurisdiction over the arbitration.

He submitted that that the respondent was constrained to file\nthe suits since the petitioner failed to respond to their repeated calls to settle the disputes through\nconciliation. This Court is unimpressed with this submission; the failure to respond to calls for\nconciliation indicates a failure of attempts to settle.

Ltd., and others (2004 (4) SCC 677) that in cases where two or more Courts\nhave jurisdiction under the Civil Procedure Code, any agreement restricting the place of suing to any\none of the Courts cannot be treated as a contract against public policy and it cannot be treated as\ncontravening Section 18 of the Contracts Act,1872.  The Supreme Court has held as follows:\n\" 14. By a long series of decisions it has been held that where two courts or more have\njurisdiction under CPC to try a suit or proceeding, an agreement between the parties\nthat the dispute between them shall be tried in any one of such courts is not contrary\nto public policy and in no way contravenes Section 28 of the Indian Contract\nAct,1872. Therefore, if on the facts of a given case more than one court has\njurisdiction, parties by their consent may limit the jurisdiction to one of the two\ncourts. But by an agreement parties cannot confer jurisdiction on a court which\notherwise does not have jurisdiction to deal with a matter. \"\n",

There is also no dispute that Clause 11 provides that disputes arising between the parties, at any time, in relation to the MOU, shall be referred to arbitration. Clause (2) of the MOU, undoubtedly, fixes the trial period upto 31st December, 2007. However, the clause also provides that the petitioner may unilaterally decide to extend the MOU, if it considers necessary. The correspondence between the parties would show that the petitioner had proposed a draft distribution agreement to the respondent for discussion. Thereafter, a series of e-mails were exchanged between the parties, but making it apparent that no final consensus was reached.\n\n\nThereafter it requests the respondents to immediately cease all sales and marking activities on behalf of REVA brand. This termination of the agreement has been acknowledged by the\nrespondents in its e-mail dated 7th October, 2009. A perusal of this e-mail would also demonstrate that the disputes had clearly arisen between the parties at that time. The e-mail makes a grievance that the respondents had not been notified of the termination of its dealership activities a few weeks\nago when it had informed the petitioner of its negotiations with potential Dutch partners. The respondents also repeated its disappointment that the win-win soft-landing solution it proposed on 25th September, 2009 was rejected by the petitioner. Rest of the correspondence between the parties continues in the same tenor. Clearly, therefore, the MOU has been extended till its\ntermination on 25th September, 2009. It is also evident that the parties had failed to reach any fresh agreement with regard to sale of REVA cars in Europe by the respondents. In my opinion, the pleadings and the material on record has clearly established that there was a valid arbitration agreement incorporated in Clause 11 of the MOU.\n\n",

        "Extracts of discussion": "45. In this context, the contractual background as pointed out by Mr. Khambatta, is required to be\nnoted to appreciate as to whether the arbitral award is oblivious to and/or unmindful of the\ncontractual conditions. As seen from the PMC agreement the role of the respondent as a Project\nManagement Consultant (PMC) was specified in Appendix-A to the PMC Agreement which was\ndivided into 'pre-tender' activities and 'post-tender activities'. The work of the respondent was in\nregard to the preparation of certain plans, survey maps, plans for existing land used and preparation\nof complete proposal alongwith layout/building plan with details of land for proposed transit camp\nand preparation of detail draft with report for sector-wise layout plan which were contained in Items\n1 to 7 under the head pre-tender activities in Appendix -A. The other items namely from item 8 to\nitem 28, mostly provided for the respondent 'to assist' the petitioner in several activities. Similarly\nunder the head post- tender activities, which contain items 1 to 39, again majority of activities were\n'to assist' the SRA under DRP. In short as urged by Mr. Khambatta learned senior counsel for the\npetitioner, activities of the respondent under the PMC agreement were defined with quite certainty ,\nrelevant for the payment of the percentage of fees as fixed and specified in the last columns of the\nrelevant appendix.\n\n\n65. In the present case as noted above the respondent by its eminent conduct evinced a clear\nintention that it is no longer required to perform its obligation under the contract and accordingly\ndemanded the retention money contrary to the terms of the contract. The petitioner also recognized\nthis and paid the retention amount which was accepted by the respondent. Thus, the principle\nechoed by this decision, in fact would assist the petitioner.\n\n\n70. The petitioner terminated PMC Agreement vide termination letter dated 4th August 2012,\ninvoking Clause 2.8.1(g) of the PMC agreement. It is clearly seen from the record that there were\nnumber of pvr 100 sonawane-rng-rane-SRA-final.doc reasons and sufficiently to the knowledge of\nthe Respondent that the DRP in the nature it was conceived, relevant to the PMC Agreement, was\nnot being implemented and/or stopped nay abandoned. Mr. Khambata has taken me through the the several clauses of the PMC agreement which are relevant to the issue of termination. Mr.\nKhambata has contended that it was an admitted position on record that the petitioner despite all\nefforts could not award the contract to any bidder. This was to the knowledge of the Respondent at\nall material times. He submitted that thus a clear situation was brought about that the contract\ncould not be awarded to any of the bidders and hence there was no question of the DRP moving\nforward for any post-tender activities much less for construction to be undertaken. Mr.Khambata\nalso has submitted that for the many intervening years the respondent had accepted this position as\nalso invoked the first arbitration unsuccessfully demanding idling charges, further litigating as if the\ncontract had fallen to the ground.\n\n72....This is clearly established on the\nfacts as explicitly staring from the evidence, which has been completely ignored and overlooked by\nthe Arbitral Tribunal. These circumstances obviously led to a consequence of the petitioner rightly\ninvoking termination clause as contained in Clause 2.8.1(g) inevitably terminating the contract.\nSurely, the circumstances were not such which can be classified to be an action on the part of the\npetitioner to have breached the contract. This apart, as noted above, the respondent itself\nundoubtedly had repudiated the contract by demanding the retention pvr 102\nsonawane-rng-rane-SRA-final.doc amount. Thus, there was a clear situation of impossibility of\nperformance of the contract and not a deliberate or intentional failure or refusal on the part of the\npetitioner to perform its obligations. The evidence on record clearly indicated that the contract had\nceased to remain on foot.\n\n\n116. The petitioner is correct in its contention that it was impossible to estimate how the Dharavi\nRedevelopment Project (DRP) pvr 140 sonawane-rng-rane-SRA-final.doc could at all have\nproceeded in the absence of successive attempts to receive bids having failed. This was also the\napprehension and expectation of the parties when they agreed to the specific termination clause,\nwhich provided an unequivocal right to the petitioner to terminate the PMC agreement in the event\nthings coming to a standstill or the contract being abandoned or for any other reason. A prudent\nbody like the arbitral tribunal was required to take these vital aspects into consideration rather than\nignoring them.\n\n",

Director,\nTown &amp; Country Planning, Haryana (2010) 14 SCC 1 that the AT could look into the purpose of the contract to interpret it. It was further contended that even assuming that GAIL could claim termination payment it had to follow the procedure under Clause 13.2 (a)(i) for which there had to be a „Shipper Event of Default.\n\n36. The third aspect of the matter is that OIPL has never attempted to defend its unilateral\ntermination of the GTA. The plea that the procedure under Clause 13.1(a) was not followed by GAIL,\nin the circumstances, appears to be misconceived. It is, in this context, be noted that sub-heading of\nClause 13.2(a) is „termination by Transporter whereas Clause 13.2(b) is „termination by Shipper.\nIn the present case the termination was by the Shipper but without following the procedure under\nClause 13.2(b). There was no occasion for GAIL to deliver any Shipper default notice under Clause\n13.2(a) for the simple reason that OIPL persuaded the GAIL with a fait accompli. It is not even\ndenied by OIPL that it stopped availing of gas supply through the pipeline with effect from 1 st\nAugust 2002. On 20th August 2012, it attributed this to incurring of heavy financial losses and the\nconsequential stoppage of production from the Sonepat Plant. It simply asked GAIL to treat the said\nletter as notice for termination of GTA. Earlier to this also the letter written by OIPL was simply\nasking for return of the BG due to losses suffered by OIPL and not because of the withdrawal of the\nspur line charges.\n",

Notwithstanding anything contained herein, School reserves the right to terminate the services of the Contractor, as School may deem proper, for reason of Contractor not carrying out its obligations set-out in this Agreement and/or for reason of any material breach of this Agreement, and Contractor agrees to pay School the damages resulting out of disruption of Transport Services in case of such termination. The Contractor shall be said to materially breach the Agreement if it fails to provide the level of services prescribed in this Agreement including but not limited to the following defaults:  a. Failure to maintain a 99% success rate at adhering with the timelines as per the rosters provided by School to pick up and drop the students. For these purposes, the performance of the Contractor will be assessed every quarter.  b. Failure to maintain the Buses (i.e. Contractor Buses and School Buses) as stated in this Agreement;  c. In the event of any accident resulting in injury or death of any student or employee of School;  d. In the event the Buses are overloaded beyond the legally permissible capacity of the buses;  e. In the event the Transport Personnel engaged by the Contractor do not fulfil the 'Minimum Conditions for Transport Personnel' set out in the Agreement;  f. In the event of breach of any other 'Conditions of Service' set out in this Agreement;  g. Any failure to comply with any and all statutory obligations; and h. Failure to maintain insurance.  34. This Agreement can be terminated by the School by giving two months written notice to the Contractor. The Contractor can terminate this Agreement only in the event the School is in breach of its obligation pertaining to payment of Contractor Fee subject to the Contractor providing prior two months written notice to the School.  35. Upon termination for any reason whatsoever, Contractor shall be liable to refund outstanding amount of advance received from School.\"",
        "Extracts of discussion": "24. The Arbitral Tribunal examined the said clauses and concluded that the petitioner was not\nentitled to terminate the Agreement during the lock-in period of five years except on the grounds as\nstated in Clause 1 of the Agreement. The Arbitral Tribunal was of the view that recourse to Clause 33\nof the Agreement was not available to the petitioner during the lock-in period. The Arbitral Tribunal\nrejected the contention that Clause 33 being a non-obstante clause, would override the other clauses\nof the Agreement and therefore, the same would entitle the petitioner to terminate the Agreement,\neven during the lock-in period, on account of any material breach on the part of the respondent. The\nArbitral Tribunal also held that the petitioner had terminated the Agreement on account of the\nalleged deficiencies in the services and not on the ground as set out in Clause 1 of the Agreement.\n\n27. A plain reading of the grounds as set out in Clause 33 of the Agreement indicates that the same\nare not mutually exclusive to the grounds as set out in Clause 1 of the Agreement. Failure to\nmaintain buses, accident resulting in injury or death of a student or an employee of the petitioner\nschool are also referred to in Clause 1 of the Agreement.\n\n28. Thus, the contention that the Agreement could not be terminated during the lock-in period on\naccount of any of the grounds as set out in Clause 33 of the Agreement is, ex facie, erroneous.\n\n29. Clause 1 of the Agreement specifies the term of the Agreement. Whereas, Clauses 33, 34 and 35\nof the Agreement fall under the heading \"Termination and Consequence of Termination\".\n\n30. In terms of Clause 34 of the Agreement, the Agreement could be terminated by the petitioner by\ngiving two months' notice to the respondent. The petitioner was not required to give any reasons for\nsuch termination. Clearly, recourse to this clause would not be available during the lock-in period.\n\n\n31. However, this Court finds it difficult to accept that Clause 33 of the Agreement could not be\navailable to the petitioner during the lock- in period. First of all, Clause 33 of the Agreement\ncommences with the non-obstante provision. Thus, it would override the other clauses of the\nAgreement. There is little reason to curtail the full import of the non- obstante clause. Second and\nmore importantly, is the nature of grounds as set out in Clause 33 of the Agreement. If the\ninterpretation as provided by the Arbitral Tribunal is accepted, it would imply that notwithstanding\nthat the respondent fails to adhere to the timelines for picking up and dropping the students;\noverloads the buses beyond legally permissible capacity; fails to perform the \"minimum conditions\nfor transport personnel\"; fails to comply with the statutory obligations; and results in an injury to any student or any employee of the petitioner, the petitioner would not be entitled not terminate the\nAgreement.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "Extracts of discussion": "34. If one considers Clause 13.3 from this perspective and keeps in mind the background that the\ncontract was to be in force for 15 years, i.e. upto 31.12.2022, the payments towards termination\nenvisioned in Clause 13.3 were by way of fixed charges or consideration for the event of pre-mature\ntermination. Clause 13 provides for different kinds of terminations in various eventualities; Clause\n13.2(b) deals with termination by the shipper. In this case, the termination notice does not invoke\nClause 13(2)(b). The reason given by the shipper, i.e. the present appellant is that the intake of gas\nwas in excess of capacity it had. Clause 13.3 underlines that if the agreement is terminated \"prior to\nthe terms of this agreement as per Clause 13.2, the GAIL had the right to suspend supplies and the\nshipper had to make the termination payment as per Exhibit E.\" To cover this eventuality, the bank\nguarantee in the format provided in Exhibit C was to be furnished. Now, the submission of Ledvance\nis that Clause 13.30 became unworkable and consequently, the termination payment could not be\ncharged by GAIL. The fallacy in this reasoning is that the linkage which is heavily underlined -\nbetween the spur line charges and termination payment is only by way of reference point. In other\nwords, the termination payment is not in respect of payment of spur line charges or has nothing to\ndo with payment related to spur line charge. Rather, the reference to spur line charge and to Exhibit\nE constitutes the referral points based on which formulation to determine termination charges are\nmade. The Tribunal's view, therefore, was clearly contrary to the contract and to the clear intention\nof the parties which was that in the event of premature termination by the shipper of the contract,\nthe GAIL was to receive the amounts.\n\n36. The Court furthermore is of the opinion that mere reference to liquidated damages and the fact\nthat Clause 13.3 did not specifically state the termination charges towards liquidated damages did\nnot in any way alter the circumstance that it was a contractual payment to cater to the eventuality of\npremature termination of the entire agreement and not merely the service of spur line for which the\ncharges seized to be recoverable. In these circumstances, the learned Single Judge's findings cannot\nbe faulted. We also notice further that after the PNGRB's order of 19.10.2010, the parties continued\nwith Clause 13.3. Also, it can be saliently noticed that Ledvance never disputed its termination of\nGTA, or said it was for reasons spelt out in Clause 13.2. Another important aspect in this case is that\non 06.03.2010, the parties had voluntarily entered into extensive amendments to the contract.\nThere too, Clause 13.3 was retained.",

        "Extracts of discussion": "70. This court finds that neither any specific issue was framed by the learned arbitrator on the point\nof termination of the contract nor any finding has been recorded by the learned arbitrator as to\nwhether the agreement was terminated or not, much less as to who terminated the contract. While\nreferring to the termination of the agreement, the learned arbitrator has only recorded the\nsubmission of the claimant in paragraph 66 of the award that according to the claimant the state\nhad terminated the contract by not performing its promise and consequently, the claimant relied\nupon the termination clause of Annexure A which provided that the State shall provide a sum\nequivalent to six months' revenue as compensation which was Rs.15,75,00,000/- (500 schools x 500\nstudents x Rs.105 per student x 6 months).\n\n\n71. The sequence of events in the present case as submitted by the learned counsel for the claimant\nclearly demonstrates that the State had issued the letter dated 30.01.2004 informing the claimant\nthat it was not possible to start the project unless the issue of revised agreement is resolved and\nconsequently, the claimant issued a letter dated 05.02.2004 indicating that the agreement dated\n02.04.2003 remained valid and subsisting and again requested the state to provide the necessary\ndetails under the contract and vide letter dated 05.04.2004 the claimant reiterated the agreement\ndated 02.04.2003 and refused to sign any revised agreement. Thus, in spite of denial of the state to\nperform its promise, the claimant still wanted to continue with the agreement dated 02.04.2003 and the claimant did not exercise its option to terminate the agreement which was voidable at the\noption of the claimant in terms of Section 53 of the Contract Act. After having issued aforesaid\nletters dated 05.02.2004 and 05.04.2004 choosing to continue with the Agreement dated\n02.04.2003, the claimant immediately raised demand before the State on 15.04.2004 to compensate\nthe claimant for liquidated damages to the extent of 15.75 crores in terms of the termination clause\nand for un-liquidated damages to the extent of Rs.22.00 Crores. The High court appointed sole\narbitrator vide order dated 25.01.2005. The learned arbitrator did not record any finding as to\nwhether the contract was terminated or not, much less, any finding on termination of contract by\nreferring to the act of inviting tender (dated 07.05.2005) or act of refusal to perform its part of the\npromise.\n\n\n72. The learned Arbitrator failed to consider and record any finding as to whether the conditions\nprecedent for invoking the aforesaid termination clause were satisfied or not satisfied prior to grant\nof liquidated damages to the claimant. The termination clause clearly provided that the contract\nwould be terminated by the claimant with three months' notice in writing on account of failure of\nthe Government of Jharkhand to reimburse the minimum committed monthly revenue as specified\nin the contract. It also appears that the State could also terminate the contract with three months'\nnotice in the event of any change in the statute of the State or policy shift. In case of any such\ntermination, the State was liable to reimburse the claimant a sum equivalent to six months' revenue\nas compensation. In the present case, neither the appellant nor the claimant terminated the contract\nin terms of the termination clause. In absence of any finding as to whether the conditions precedent\nin terms of the termination clause were satisfied or not, there was no occasion for the learned\narbitrator to award liquidated damages in terms of the termination clause. This Court finds that\nthough the learned arbitrator has recorded the termination clause but has neither interpreted the\ntermination clause nor examined as to whether there was any termination of agreement in terms\ntermination clause which provided for stipulation of liquidated damages only if the conditions\nprescribed therein were satisfied. On the face of the termination clause, it provided for specific mode\nand manner of termination in order to claim liquidated damages. Admittedly, the agreement was\nnot terminated by the claimant and it was the specific case of the appellant State that the agreement\nwas never terminated. Admittedly, no finding has been recorded with regards to termination of\nagreement much less termination in terms of the termination clause and the learned arbitrator\ngranted liquidated damages under the termination clause. Further the fundamental principle of\ncontract law as applicable in India is that the compensation has to be reasonable even while granting\nliquidated damages whether by way of penalty or by way of compensation in the light of the law\nsettled by the Hon'ble Supreme court in the aforesaid judgements. The law with regards to damages\nhas been settled by holding that the most basic principle on the award of damages is that,\ncompensation can only be given for damage or loss suffered. If damage or loss is not suffered, the\nlaw does not provide for a windfall. It has also been settled that Section 74 of Indian Contract Act is\nto be read along with Section 73 of the aforesaid Act and, therefore, in every case of breach of\ncontract, the person aggrieved by the breach is not required to prove actual loss or damage suffered\nby him before he can claim a decree. The court is competent to award reasonable compensation in\ncase of breach even if no actual damage is proved to have been suffered in consequence of the breach of a contract.\n\n-- the learned arbitrator has neither interpreted the termination clause nor recorded any finding as\nto whether the agreement was terminated or not and if terminated, at whose instance it was\nterminated in order to attract the liquidated damages under the termination clause.\n\n--Further no finding has been recorded as to whether the conditions precedent to claim liquidated\ndamages in terms of the termination clause were satisfied or not.\n",

        "Contract clause": "32.4 Termination for MSRDC Event of Default. CARBP371.17.doc 32.4.1 The Concessionaire may after giving 90 (ninety) days notice in writing to MSRDC terminate this Agreement upon the occurrence and continuation of any of the following events (each a MSRDC Event of Default) unless any such MSRDC Event of Default has occurred as a result of Concessionaire Event of Default or due to Force Majeure Event.

        "Extracts of discussion": "72. From the aforesaid termination notice, it is clear that the said notice was issued under clause\n32.4 of the Concession Agreement. Clause 32.4.1 clearly required PLUS to give a 90 day notice in\nwriting to MSRDC for terminating the Agreement upon occurrence and continuation of any of the\nevents of default as set out therein. The 90 day period was to enable MSRDC to cure any breach or\nto take effective steps for curing the same. However, in the aforesaid notice, PLUS requests MSRDC\nto issue, by 28th April, CARBP371.17.doc 2013, the extension of the concession period and the Toll\nNotification upto 10th July, 2024 failing which the Concession Agreement is to stand terminated on\n28th April, 2013. From the aforesaid notice it is clear that time was granted to MSRDC to cure any\ndefect on its part from 19th March, 2013 to 28th April, 2013. This is far less than the period of 90\ndays as stipulated in clause 32.4.1. On a plain reading of the said notice, I find that the submission of\nMr. Chagla is well founded when he submits that the findings given by the Tribunal that MSRDC\nhad much more than 90 days to cure the breaches, is factually incorrect. I must mention that the\nTribunal whilst coming to the aforesaid finding opined that PLUS had held out the prospect of\ntermination long before 19th March, 2013 and refrained from issuing a formal notice at the specific\nrequest of MSRDC. In this regard, the only letter referred to by the Tribunal is a letter dated 4th\nFebruary, 2013 issued by PLUS to MSRDC (paragraph 43 of the impugned Award). By the said\nletter, PLUS informs MSRDC that in the spirit of amicable settlement, PLUS desires to draw the\nattention of MSRDC to the Toll Notification which is valid upto 28th April, 2013 whereas their\nactual original concession period runs upto 3rd March, 2015. It therefore informs MSRDC that\ndespite the present Toll Notification expiring less than CARBP371.17.doc 90 days from the date of\nthe said letter, PLUS' right to serve a termination notice under the Concession Agreement remains\nintact and in full force and they reserve their right to exercise the right of termination any time\nbefore 28th April, 2013 and such notice, if and when served upon MSRDC, shall be fully binding on\nMSRDC with respect to its obligation to pay Termination Payment as certified by the statutory\nauditors of PLUS. This letter is clearly not a termination notice as contemplated under clause 32.4.1\nof the Concession Agreement. Be that as it may, even if I was to assume that this letter is a notice as\ncontemplated under clause 32.4.1, the time period between 4th February, 2013 till 28th April, 2013\n(the date on which the Toll Notification came to an end), still does not comply with the period of 90\ndays, as contemplated under the aforesaid clause. I am in agreement with Mr. Chagla that\ntermination of a contract has serious consequences. Therefore, termination under clause 32.4.1\nrequires strict compliance. Failure to give notice of 90 days would clearly render the termination\nunder clause 32.4.1 of the Concession Agreement illegal and invalid. I therefore am of the view that\nthe finding of the Tribunal in so far as it upholds the termination of the Concession Agreement\nunder clause 32.4 suffers from a patent illegality as its findings run in the CARBP371.17.doc teeth of the plain language of clause 32.4.1 and hence cannot be sustained.\n\n\n73. As far as the argument of Mr. Chagla that the actions/omissions of MSRDC did not have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the project, I am unable to agree with the same as that is a question of fact\nwhich is examined by the Tribunal. The Tribunal finds that the record is replete with\ncorrespondence from PLUS pointing out how this delay is constraining its cash flow position, and\njeopardizing operations. This would clearly amount to a material adverse effect on the project.\nHowever, as mentioned earlier, termination under Clause 32.4.1 cannot be held to be valid in view of\nthe fact that a 90 day notice was not given by PLUS to MSRDC as contemplated in clause 32.4.1 of\nthe Concession Agreement.\n\n74. Despite having held that the termination of the Concession Agreement under clause 32.4 cannot\nbe held to be valid, I find that it makes little difference in the present matter. As noted earlier, the\nConcession Agreement could be terminated under Clauses 29.8 as well as 32.4. Even if one of them\nis held to be valid CARBP371.17.doc then the Concession Agreement would stand validly terminated.\nConsidering that I have held that the findings of the Tribunal regarding termination of the\nConcession Agreement under Clause 29.8 does not require any interference, it makes little\ndifference whether termination under Clause 32.4 is held valid or otherwise. This is more so when\none takes into consideration that the Termination Payment formula under clause 29.9(c) and 32.4.2\nis exactly the same.\n",

        "Extracts of discussion": "37. A perusal of Clauses 37.3.1 and 37.3.2 makes it evident that even where the termination is on\naccount of the default of the petitioner, NHAI is liable to pay by way of Termination Payment an\namount equal to 90% of the debt due, less insurance cover. There is no dispute between the parties\nthat the agreement stands terminated at the instance of the NHAI. Thus, prima facie by virtue of the\nClauses mentioned above, respondent is liable to pay at least 90% of the debt outstanding. The\nconcession agreement gives a comfort to the lenders that their debt is secured, inasmuch as,\nwhatever be the reason for termination, they are at least assured of 90% of the outstanding debt. It\nis also pertinent to notice at this stage the stand of the petitioner that more than 95% of the work\nhad been completed and a Provisional Completion Certificate for at least 80% of the work done was\nissued by the independent Engineer, on 20.8.2015.\n\n39. In fact the interpretation of this Clause is no longer res-integra. A Co- ordinate Bench of this\nCourt in O.M.P.(I) (COMM) 221/2017 was dealing with a similar Concession Agreement, with an\nidentical clause of Termination Payment i.e. 37.3.1 and 37.3.2. Significantly the respondent in the\nsaid matter was NHAI. The question that arose before the Co-ordinate Bench was release of 90% of\nthe debt due as Termination Payment. After examining the law, under Section 9 of the Act, the Court\ndirected NHAI to deposit the Termination Payment (balance of the 90% of the debt due) in the\nESCROW Account. The said judgment was carried in appeal by the NHAI and the Division Bench in\nFAO(OS) 166/2017 dismissed the appeal on 27.10.2017. SLP being No. 35078/2017 was dismissed\nby the Apex Court on 5.1.2018. A reading of the judgment of the Division Bench makes it clear that\nClause 37.3.1 of the Concessionaire Agreement has been interpreted to entitle the petitioner to 90%\nof the debt due even when the default is of the petitioner. The said interpretation as given by the Coordinate Bench in the case of Jetpur (supra) has been upheld by the Division Bench and affirmed by\nthe Apex Court. \n\n40. In fact, the Division Bench has also adjudicated on the question of exercise of power by the\nCourt under Section 9 of the Act. Referring to the various clauses of the Concessionaire Agreement\nthe Court has categorically held that Clause 37.3.1 is an express and mandatory provision and has to\nbe given effect to even where the agreement is terminated on account of the fault of the\nconcessionaire. \n",

        "Extracts of discussion": "I have noted the guidelines for the exercise of the power, preamble, relevant sections from which the reasons should be inferred and recorded, although they need not be communicate. These should be\nrecorded in order to ensure effective judicial review in a given case. Termination simpliciter under Regulation 9(b) or similar powers can be exercised only in circumstances other than those in regulation\n9(a). The exercise of such powers can only be for purposes germane and relevant to the statute. There are several illustrations of that, namely, the employee is incompetent or unsuitable so as to make his continuance in the employment detrimental to the interest of the institu- tion, where the\ncontinuance of the employee is a grave security risk making his continuance detrimental to the interest of the Corporation and where because of the conduct of the employee, there is lack of\nconfidence in the employee which makes it necessary in the interest of the Corporation to immediately terminate the services of the employee. These, however, are illustrative and not exhaustive. There- fore, each case of the conferment of the power involved should be decided on the\naforesaid basis.\n\n\n\n38. At the cost of repetition it is to reiterate that when the authority intends to take disciplinary action for imposing penalty of dismissal, removal or reduction in rank of an employee, an elaborate\nprocedure has been provided in Regulation 15 to conduct an enquiry into misconduct after giving reasonable opportunity. Residuary power has been avowedly conferred in Regulation 9(b) with wide\ndiscretion on the appropriate authority to take actions on similar set of facts but without any guidelines or procedure at the absolute discretion of the same authority. The language of Regulation 9(b) is not capable of two interpretations. This power appears to be in addition to the normal power in Regulation 15. Thereby the legislative intention is manifest that it intended to confer such draconian power couched in language of width which hangs like Damocles sword on the neck of the employee, keeping every employee on tenterhook under constant pressure of uncertainty,\nprecarious tenure at all times right from the date of appointment till date of superannuation. It equally enables the employer to pick and choose an employee at whim or vagary to terminate the serv- ice arbitrarily and capriciously.\n\n39. Regulation 9(b), thereby deliberately conferred wide power of termination of services of the employee without following the principle of audi alteram partem or even modicum of procedure of\nrepresentation before terminating the services of permanent employee. It is well settled rule of statutory construction that when two interpretations are possible one which would preserve and save constitutionality of a particular Statute, would be preferred to the other that would render it unconstitutional and void. When the language is clear, unambiguous and specific and it does not lead to the constructions, it is not permissible to read into those provisions something which is not intended. It is undoubtedly true as rightly contended by Mr. Ashok Desai, the learned Solicitor General that the power to take appropriate and expeditious action to meet the exigencies of weeding out inefficient, corrupt, indolent officers or employees from service should be provided and\npreserved to the competent authority. Any action taken without any modicum of reasonable procedure and prior oppor- tunity always generates an unquenchable feeling that unfair treatment\nwas meted out to the aggrieved employee. To pre- vent miscarriage of justice or to arrest a nursing grievance that arbitrary, whimsical or capricious action was taken behind the back of an employee\nwithout opportunity, the law must provide a fair, just and reasonable procedure as is exigible in a given circumstances as adumbrated in proviso to Art. 311(2) of the Constitution.\n\n43. In view of the march of law made by Art. 14, in particular after Maneka Gandhi's case, it is too late in the day to contend that the competent authority would be vested with wide discretionary\npower without any proper guidelines or the procedure. The further contention that the preamble, the other rules and the circumstances could be taken aid of in reading down the provisions of the\nimpugned rules or the regulations is also of no assistance when it is found that the legislative intention is unmistakably clear, unambiguous and specific. Thus considered, I have no hesitation to\nconclude that the impugned regulation 9(b) of the Regula- tions are arbitrary, unjust, unfair and unreasonable offend- ing Arts. 14, 16(1), 19(1)(g) and 21 of the Constitution. It is also opposite to the\npublic policy and thereby is void under Section 23 of the Indian Contract Act.",

The agreement is renewable\nand/or could be amended from time to time. To find out as to whether there is an element of sale involved when software is delivered to its customer, the terms and conditions of EULA are material.\nClause 1.1 of the EULA relates to installation and use. It authorises an individual to (a) install and use a copy of the software on a personal computer or other device; and (b) install an additional copy\nof the software on a second, portable device for the exclusive use of the primary user of the first copy of the software. \n\n\nFrom the above, the dominant intention of the parties would show that the developer or the creator keeps back the copyright of each software, be it canned, packaged or customised, and what is transferred to the network subscriber, namely, the members of the association, is only the right to use with copyright protection. By that agreement, even the developer does not sell the software as such. By that Master End-User License Agreement, the members of petitioner-association again\nenter into an End-User License Agreement for marketing the software as per the conditions stipulated therein. In common parlance, end user is a person who uses a product or utilises theservice. An end user of a computer software is one who does not have any significant contact with the developer/creator/designer of the software. According to Webster's New World Telecom dictionary, an end user is \"the ultimate user of a product or service, especially of a computer system, application or network.\" On a careful reading of the above, we are of the considered view that when a transaction takes place between the members of ISODA with its customers, it is not the sale of the software as such, but only the contents of the data stored in the software which would amount to\nonly service. To bring the deemed sale under Article 366(29A)(d) of the Constitution of India, there must be a transfer of right to use any goods and when the goods as such is not transferred, the question of deeming sale of goods does not arise and in that sense, the transaction would be only a service and not a sale.",

        "Extracts of discussion": "In regard to the interpretation of clause 8 of the agreement, the High\nCourt while opining that there was absolutely no dispute whatsoever that the Appellant-Bank advanced more than 60% of the value of the land, building, machinery and structures in favour of the Company posed a question which, according to it, fell for its consideration, namely, as to whether the Company as well the Syndicate Bank obtained prior consent of the government in the matter as was required under clause 8(b) of the agreement. The High Court having opined that no prior consent of the Government was taken by the Appellant-Bank before advancing more than 60% of the value of the land came to the conclusion that the letter dated\n03.08.1972 of the Director of Industries could not be treated as a document of title enabling the Company to create a charge against the properties belonging to APIIC. It was held that there was nothing on record to show that the said letter had been issued by the Director of Industries with the prior approval of the government. \n\n\nIt was further held that the letter of the Director dated 03.08.1972\ncannot be said to be in terms of clause 8(b) of the agreement and, thus, the appellant cannot be allowed to say that the land had been completely utilised\nfor industrial purposes, in absence of any such assertion and proof furnished by the Company itself. \n\n(b) that the Syndicate Bank admittedly advanced more than 60% of the value of the land but without prior agreement of the Government as is required in terms of clause 8(b) of the agreement. Therefore, the APIIC, being the successor in interest of the Government, is not bound by the advances so made by the Syndicate Bank. Therefore, the Syndicate Bank cannot have the first charge over the property in question;\n\n\nThere cannot be any doubt whatsoever that in absence of a registered deed of sale, the title to the land does not pass, but then what would not be conveyed is the title of the estate and not the allotment and possession itself.\n\nIt would, therefore, appear that there is no clear authority on the question as to whether in absence of any title deed in terms whereof the mortgagee obtained title by reason of a registered deed can be a subject- matter of mortgage. Section 58 of the Transfer of Property Act does not speak of mortgage of an owner's interest. If any interest in property can be created by reason of a transaction or otherwise which does not require registration, in our opinion, it may not be necessary to have a full title before such a mortgage is created by deposit of title deeds. \n\n",

        "Extracts of discussion": " 25 All the three courts, including the High Court, grossly erred in the manner in which they have\nadjudicated upon this dispute in a suit for specific performance. In the first instance, the trial court\nfailed to frame an issue on whether the respondent-plaintiff was ready and willing to perform his\nobligations under the contract and instead assessed whether he is entitled to the relief of specific\nperformance. In doing so, the trial court viewed the legal issue from an incorrect lens. The\nfoundation of a suit for specific performance lies in ascertaining whether the plaintiff has come to\nthe court with clean hands and has, through his conduct, demonstrated that he has always been\nwilling to perform the contract. There is a conspicuous absence in judgment of the trial court of any\nreference to evidence led by the respondent to indicate his willingness to perform the contract. The\ntrial court merely adverted to “document produced on behalf of the plaintiff” and concluded that he\nhad sufficient means to purchase the suit property. Apart from this observation, the judgment fails\nto analyse the terms of the agreement, the obligations of the parties and the conduct of the\nrespondent or the appellant.\n\n\nPART C 27 The respondent has alleged that he did not pay the balance consideration as the\nappellants failed to remove the encumbrance on the suit property. First of all, we note that the\nagreement to sell the suit property did not specifically record the mortgage over the suit property.\nHowever, neither has the appellant denied the existence of the mortgage nor has the respondent\nclaimed that he was unaware of the encumbrance over the suit property at the time of entering into\nthe agreement. The agreement did not expressly detail whose liability it is to discharge the\nmortgage.\n\n28 Having said that, the terms of the agreement stipulated that the respondent was to pay the\nbalance consideration within a period of six months and “on receipt of the balance consideration”,\nthe appellants were to execute the sale deed “pertaining to the property free from all\nencumbrances”. It is evident from the agreement that the liability to deliver the property free from\nany encumbrance was on the appellants. However, this obligation is prefaced by the condition that\nthe appellants would be required to execute the sale deed free from encumbrance on the receipt of\nthe balance consideration. Thus, the agreement did not specify when the appellants should\ndischarge their mortgage- before the expiry of six months, after receipt of the advance amount, or\nafter receipt of the balance consideration. It only obligated them to ensure that after the balance\nconsideration is received, the sale deed executed should be free from encumbrances. Based on a\nplain reading of the agreement, we are unable to accept the respondents plea that he was willing to\nperform his obligations under the contract. It is evident that he was required to pay the remaining\nconsideration (or indicate his willingness to pay) and only then could have sought specific PART C\nperformance of the contract. The respondent has also urged that the additional amount of Rs.\n10,000 was paid to the appellants to discharge the mortgage. The acknowledgment signed by the\nappellants indicates that the money was to meet urgent family expenses. Since no further details\nhave been provided and no evidence has been adduced by the respondent-plaintiff, we cannot\nconclude that the money was for discharge of the mortgage. Even assuming that the respondent is\ncorrect, the agreement still required the respondent to pay the balance consideration. In this regard,\nthe High Court, while holding in favour of the respondent, has noted that the appellants were free to\ndemand a further amount for discharging the mortgage. This finding ignores the plain terms of the\ncontract. The agreement clearly provided that the balance consideration would be paid and then the\nsale deed would be executed. How the appellants chose to discharge the mortgage was for them to\ndecide. The respondent had to prove his readiness and willingness to perform the contract.\n",

        "Extracts of discussion": "23. By careful reading of the said clause of the lease deed having regard to the\nundisputed fact that the demised premises was mortgaged in favour of the mortgagee\nwith possession as the appellant had executed mortgage deed in his favour on\n12.01.1962, he continued to be a mortgagee till the property was redeemed in his\nfavour on 15.4.1983.\n\n\nIt is also the case of the first respondent that it had sent a notice for renewal of the lease deed to the\nappellant, but not to the mortgagee as he had stepped into the shoes of the owner of the mortgaged\nproperty till the same was redeemed to the appellant on 15.04.1983. In view of the above undisputed\nfact to avail the benefit of Clause 3 (d) of the lease deed, the first respondent should have sent the\nnotice to the mortgagee of the property seeking renewal of lease of the demised property as provided\nunder the above clause. Therefore, the first respondent Corporation has failed to exercise its right to\nget the renewal of lease in respect of the demised premises. This aspect of the matter has been\noverlooked by both the trial court as well as the High Court though the first appellate court\nconsidered this aspect of the matter in its judgment. Therefore, the determination of tenancy of the\ndemised property by the appellant under Section 106 of the T.P. Act is perfectly legal and valid.\nFurther, it has been held that the first respondent after termination of tenancy continued in\npossession of the property as a tenant of holding-over. Thus, in law, holding over of the suit\nschedule property by the first respondent after the termination of lease is that of a trespasser not a\ntenant and therefore, it becomes liable to pay mesne profits by way of damages to the appellants.\n\n\nHaving regard to the undisputed facts of the case in hand,\nthe second appellate court has not rightly interpreted clause 3 (d) of the lease deed and the same is\ncontrary to the facts and therefore, the finding recorded on the substantial question of law and\nholding that there is a deemed renewal of the demised property for a period of 20 years in view of\nthe notice dated 1.4.1980 sent to the appellant but not to the mortgagee is not only erroneous but\nalso error in law, therefore, the said finding is liable to be set aside.\n\n\n25. In view of the undisputed facts referred to supra and the clause 3 (d) of the lease deed regarding\nthe renewal of lease for a period of 20 years after expiry of the initial period of renewal it has come\nto an end on 1.7.2000. Therefore, the first appellate court was right in holding that the possession of\nthe demised property by the first respondent Corporation is holding over month to month and\ntherefore it is a trespasser of the said schedule property and therefore invoking Section 106 of the\nT.P. Act by the appellant and determining the tenancy by him and filing the suit for arrears of rent\nand also decree of ejectment of the first respondent from the demised premises is legally justified.\nFurther, with reference to Section 7 of the Caltex Act the action of the first respondent is unfair as\nthere is no fairness, reasonableness and non- arbitrariness on its part to avail the right under the\nabove provision for continuing as a tenant in respect of the demised property. Hence, we are\nrequired to set aside the impugned judgment of the second appellate court and restore the judgment\nand decree of the first appellate court. The first respondent Corporation is not even willing to give\nfair and reasonable rent as it has offered only Rs.5000/- per month whereas the rental market value of the property according to the appellants counsel is more than Rs.30,000/- per month.",

If a document is not duly stamped and registered, despite the law requiring the same to be stamped and registered, it is inadmissible in evidence. But in this case, it was the plaintiff who filed the Loan Agreement dated 01.8.1995 as Ex.P4 and the registered mortgage deed as Ex.P2 and the Memorandum and Deposit of Title Deeds as Ex.P3. The defendants did not seek to mark them. In fact, the plaintiffs filed the unregistered Loan Agreement, for the purpose of assailing Clauses 17 and 18 of the same. If Ex.P4 is thrown out as inadmissible in evidence for want of stamp duty and registration, automatically the challenge to clauses 17 and 18 of the same should also be thrown out, as the Agreement itself will not be on record.\n\n35.6. But the above contention has no basis in view of two facts viz., (a) that under Clauses 17 and 18 of Ex.P4 (Loan Agreement), the mortgagee is entitled to appropriate the sale proceeds first towards the discharge of the second loan; and (b) that the mortgagor also executed a deed of irrevocable power of attorney under Ex.D44, enabling the mortgagee to sell the property as the agent of the mortgagor. There is no law which prohibits a mortgagee from doing this. If the contention of the plaintiff that the right of sale without the intervention of Court should have been exercised by the mortgagee only for the amount of Rs.25 lakhs is accepted, it would lead to ridiculous consequences. In other words, if the plaintiffs contention is accepted, the mortgagee should first sell the property at his cost, recover only Rs.25 lakhs with interest and return the excess sale consideration to the mortgagor and thereafter, file a suit and wait for a preliminary decree, a final decree and execution to realise the same amount. I am sure the plaintiff would not choose such a course of action, if they had advanced money to somebody.\n\n35.8. Unfortunately, the plaintiffs have misunderstood and mixed up two independent questions, one relating to the right of sale under Section 69 and another relating to appropriation of the sale proceeds. Once the plaintiffs agree that the mortgagee has a right of sale under Section 69, then the only question left to be decided would be about appropriation of the sale proceeds. Apart from the fact that the mortgagee had the right of appropriation, under Clauses 17 and 18 of Ex.P4, it is to be noted that the plaintiffs have not come up with any suit for refund of the balance consideration. Even assuming without admitting for the sake of argument that the entire sale proceeds could not have been appropriated, the only remedy open to the plaintiff is to seek refund of money, but not to question the sale itself.",

However, as can be seen from clause 3 of the General condition quoted above, the sub-contracting was clearly contemplated by the parties and was provided for in their agreement. The relevant material and evidence placed before the arbitrator clearly shows that MII was the principal sub-contractor and has all throughout been in picture in the contract between the appellant and the respondent. In fact it is because of the expertise of MII that it was given a pivotal role in the execution of the entire contract. The appellant had entered into a back to back contract with MII to the knowledge of the respondent. The performance of their obligation under the sub- contract by MII, formed part and parcel of appellant's obligations under the Head-contract.

        "Extracts of discussion": "\n 21.Reading of Clause III (b) of the lease deed dated 18.10.2000 would clearly indicate that only if the\nLessor intend to sell the property, the Lessee can exercise the first option to purchase and if such\noption is exercised, they will have the first preference.

Clause I (j) of the Lease deed dated 18.10.2000 deals with renewal of lease period for further period of 20 years if both the parties mutually agree. In this case, the plaintiffs in the Junior Suit has obviously made clear to the defendant (IOCL) through their legal notices dated 15.11.2017 and 01.12.2017 that they have no intention of renewing the lease since, the land requires for them to establish their family business.\n\n22.It is also necessary to note that under the terms of lease, the defendant (IOCL) has expressly retained the right of determining the lease prematurely by issuing three months prior notice in\nwriting and in the event of such determination, the Lessor cannot claim compensation whatsoever. Though there is no reciprocal provision, the same right of termination or determination should vest\nimpliedly. The Lessor also have the right of determination refusal to extend the lease. The legal notices dated 15.11.2017 and 01.12.2017 are the notices of determination issue to the Lessee.\n\n",

        "Extracts of discussion": "84. So, there are clauses in the lease deed dated 14.12.1981 which had been expressly agreed between the parties and in the presence of such clauses, implying the intention of creating a perpetual lease would be wholly inconsistent. The document does not convey any such intention, therefore, it is not possible to infer that the parties intended to create a perpetual lease.\n\n85. From the foregoing paras, the only conclusion that can be drawn is that the lease deed dated 14.12.1981 is not clear about the period for which the tenancy was created between the parties. In view of this lacuna left in the document, the defendants have attempted to take advantage by asking this Court to read the lease deed in a manner construing it to be a perpetual lease deed. However, the defendants are not able to discharge the onus cast upon them to make good the aforesaid attempt of proving it as a perpetual lease. Thus, issue no.2 is decided against the defendants. Upon this failure, the rule of construction as embodied under Section 106 of Transfer of Property Act comes into play and the purpose of lease being commercial (other than agricultural and manufacturing). Issue no.1 is accordingly decided in favour of the plaintiffs and against the defendants.",

        "Extracts of discussion": "30. It is evident that Section 49 of The Registration Act bars the reception of any document, which was not registered, in evidence. In this case, the appellant/defendant relies on Ex.A-3, Memorandum of Understanding and contend that it was not registered and therefore, it cannot be admitted in evidence. In fact, Ex.A-3, Memorandum of Understanding was marked before the trial court subject to objection by the appellant/defendant. However, the defendant relies on clause 4 and\n6 of the Memorandum of Understanding, Ex.A-3 to contend that the plaintiff has no right to determine the tenancy and he should continue the lease for the entire period specified therein. Thus, the defendant cannot approbate and reprobate as regards the Memorandum of Understanding, Ex.A-3. Admittedly, when Ex.A-3 was not registered and the period stipulated in clause 4 thereof indicates that the lease will be for a period of ten years, it is inadmissible in evidence. Therefore, the contract between the plaintiff and the defendant will partake the character of an oral contract. This is more so that the defendant admits the receipt of lease advance of Rs.20 lakhs and also did not\ndispute that the plaintiff paid the lease rent of Rs.10,000/- every month during the subsistence of lease atleast till the plaintiff issued Ex.A-4 notice dated 12.02.2000 determining the lease and calling upon the defendant to refund the advance amount of Rs.20 lakhs. Therefore,  as discussed above, a party to a lease of an immovable property has an implied right to determine the tenancy by giving advance intimation within a reasonable period. In fact, Section 106 of The Transfer of Property deals with the consequences that may flow when the lease of immovable property is not registered. As per Section 106 (3) and (4), in case the contract is oral, a party to such a contract must issue a notice in writing or serve such notice in person expressing his intention to determine the contract. In this case, the plaintiff has issued the notice\ndated 12.02.2000, Ex.A4 expressing his intention to determine the tenancy on or before\n10.05.2000, giving three months prior notice of his intention to quit. The receipt of the notice dated 12.02.2000, Ex.A-4 was also acknowledged by the defendant and he also sent a reply dated 30.03.2000, Ex.A-5, of course, refusing to determine the lease before the expiry of it's term of ten years. Thus, the notice dated 12.02.2000, Ex.A4 sent by the plaintiff is in consonance with Section 106 (3) and (4) of The Transfer of Property Act and therefore, we hold that the termination of lease\nby the plaintiff through notice dated 12.02.2000, Ex.A-4 is valid and it will bind the defendant in all respects. Even if Ex.A-3, Memorandum of Understanding is kept aside from consideration, the intention behind the parties could be inferred from the other documentary evidence. In effect, the non- registration of Memorandum of Understanding will not preclude the plaintiff from seeking the relief of refund of advance amount especially when the receipt of such amount was admitted by the\ndefendant. The defendant refused to determine the lease by offering a strange explanation that the amount so received from the plaintiff towards lease advance has been put on investments and the investments cannot be withdrawn or terminated prematurely. Merely because the defendant has invested the lease advance amount in financial institution or otherwise, it cannot be a ground to refuse to take back possession of the leasehold premises http://www.judis.nic.in when it was offered by the plaintiff. Thus, we hold that the non-registration of Ex.A- 3, Memorandum of Understanding will not have a bearing on the plaintiff in claiming refund of the advance lease amount from the defendant, when the termination of the lease is held to be valid. Accordingly, we answer Point No. (ii) and (iii) also in favour of the plaintiff and against the defendant.",

In nutshell, the learned Arbitrator after discussion the entire case of the parties has come to the conclusion that the registered lease deed dated 12th February, 2001 was for a period of 9 years. The letter dated 12 th February, 2001 is merely an offer and the same cannot be relied upon. It has been held that the said letter therefore does not inspire confidence to believe that the respondent intended to do a lease for further period of 9 years. Assuming that said letter was signed by the petitioner. It was merely an offer and at no point of time during the term of lease the petitioner exercise or assert the purported letter of intent who made a reference in its letter dated 10th March, 2010 after the expiry of the lease.\n\nThe petitioner has failed to show any oral or documentary evidence that the offer made by the respondent stood accepted before the offer stood withdrawn by the respondent. As there was no offer in existence and exercise of option by the petitioner subsequent to the expiry of the lease deed i.e. on 9th March, 2010 is of no consequence in terms of 14 of the lease deed thus lease cannot be renewed after the expiry of nine years. Therefore, there was no conclusion contract between the parties.\n\n26. It is argued by Mr. Sethi, learned Senior counsel that the alleged letter of intent in view of the said clauses even otherwise could not have been signed by the respondent alone for the purpose of specific condition stipulated under the renewal Clause 14 of the Lease Agreement read with Clauses\n21 (c) &amp; 23 of the same as in these clauses, it is specifically mentioned that there would be no waiver, alteration or modification of the agreement unless the same inter alia are duly executed by both the\nparties. The said stipulation cannot be ignored under the law which was supposed to be complied strictly within the meaning of Section 116 of the Transfer of Property Act.",

The agreement further states that during the currency of the lease, the lessee shall insure the subject of lease and protect it from any risk. Clause 10 of the agreement states that without the prior written consent of the lessor, the lessee shall not make any alterations, additions or improvements to the equipment and all additions, replacements, attachments and improvements of whatever kind or nature made to the equipment shall be deemed to be parts of the property of the lessor and shall be subject to all the terms and conditions of the agreement. Clause 13 speaks about the surrender of the lease equipment upon the expiration of earlier termination of the lease agreement. It also gives the option for renewal on year to year basis on mutually agreed terms and conditions. Clause 15 deals with payment by lessor and Clause 20 is to the effect of the expiration of the lease, which stipulates that on expiration of the lease term, if the lessee fails to deliver the equipment to the lessor in accordance with any direction given by the Lessor, the lessee shall be deemed to be the monthly tenant of the equipment and upon the same terms expressed in the agreement and the tenancy should be terminated by the lessor immediately upon default committed by the lessee by serving seven (7) days notice. Clause 19 speaks about the default clause and the termination by default under Clause 24. Clause 33 speaks about the Assignment rights stating that no title or right in the property shall be passed to the lessee except the lease rights expressly granted to the lessee. It also stipulates that plates or other marking shall be fixed indicating that the lessor is the owner thereof and that the lessee would not remove the same. Upon termination of the lease period, the lessee shall immediately return the said property to Lessor in as good condition and received less normal wear, tear and depreciation.

Consequently, the agreement has to be seen only as a finance agreement. We do not find any justification to accept this as a ground for holding the agreement as a finance lease agreement. If in effect the agreement is finance agreement, the question of returning the leased\nitem back to the assessee will not arise at all. Further, the question of again affixing the name of the assessee on the property also does not arise. The fact that the equipment is delivered by the supplier to the location of the assessee thus by itself, will not make the agreement, the Finance Agreementand the terms thus seen are matters of arrangement between the parties, which in effect clearly points out that it is only a simple lease agreement and not a finance agreement. As has been\ncontended by the Revenue, even in the calculation of the lease rental, the monthly repayment of the rent and the number of months of the lease rent payment is also clearly stated in the agreement.",

        "Extracts of discussion": "9.1 It is abundantly clear from the above discussion of relevant facts on record and the legal contentions that the claim of the appellants for interim relief is primarily based on their supposed right to be considered for renewal of leases which were granted to them and of which the terms have expired since long. Even the period of extension of the lease granted to the appellants at the behest of the Central Government, with retrospective effect, have expired on 01.4.2011. Now for consideration of further extension, renewal or fresh grant of leases, clause 6.2.2.2 of the Land Policy\nfor Major Ports, 2010 has to be applied and followed. Therefore, it is impossible to hold that, as on the date of filing of the petitions, the appellants had any legal right to claim or continue possession of the lands in question, or to contend that they were not in unauthorized occupation of the premises. Therefore, even in absence of any other litigation pending in another High Court or successive orders of such court, which are binding on the respondents, it would, prima facie, be very difficult to hold that illegal occupation by the appellants of the leased lands ought to have been protected. There is nothing on record to suggest that non-renewal of leases beyond 01.04.2011 was\nin any way illegal or arbitrary or that KPT or Union of India was under any legal obligation to exclusively consider the cases of the appellant for grant of lease for any further period. In fact, even the renewal of leases upto 31.03.2011 appears to be the subject-matter of enquiry and investigation by the CBI. Prima facie, the original transfer of lands on lease by KPT to the appellants was a contract of which the term was expressly pre-determined and, therefore, its termination did not involve any issue of compliance with principles of natural justice and it is not even claimed by the\nrespondents that they had a vested right to renewal of leases. In view of recent decision of the Apex Court in Shanti Prasad Devi (supra) and Centre for Public Interest Litigation (supra), there could be no implied renewal of leases, and public authorities are required to adopt a transparent and fair method for disposal of public property and a largess cornered by a few businessmen could not be perpetuated in violation of the Fundamental Rights vested in others or in a manner inconsistent with the Directive Principles of State Policy. In the facts of the present cases, as was rightly pointed\nout by learned counsel for the respondents, the appellants have been engaging the respondents in one after other legal battles simultaneously in at least four forums without even depositing huge amounts of compensation and fees for which bills are already raised by KPT. Therefore, we do not find any prima facie case in favour of the appellants, either in law or in equity, for grant of any discretionary relief, particularly when practically the claim now is for restoration rather than protection of possession of the lands in question. In absence of a reasonably good prima facie case in\nfavour of the appellants, the issues of balance of convenience and irreparable loss pale into insignificance and irrelevance.",

        "Extracts of discussion": "31. Clause 1(h) in Ext.A1 quoted above is positioned after the specific provisions wherein the parties have decided to give and take the property on lease. In otherwords, the clause showing the vestiture of leasehold right preceded clause I(h). For a proper and complete interpretation of Ext.A1, I have gone through the deposition of DW1. In the affidavit filed in lieu of the chief examination, he has asserted that they had spent lot of amounts for reclaiming the land and for erecting the structures and fixtures for starting a petrol bunk. Considering the age of the witness at the time of deposition, it goes without saying that he is incompetent to prove the actual amount that might have been spent by the original lessee to make up the land suitable for petroleum business. No other evidence was adduced to establish this case of the defendants. Therefore, there is no extraneous evidence available in this case to find that the stipulations in clause I(h) of Ext.A1 regarding renewals were made considering the cost that would have been incurred by the lessee for making the land suitable for a petroleum outlet. Even though in the proviso to clause I(h) of Ext.A1 it is mentioned that the lease will be under the same covenants and conditions including the covenant for renewal, the clause which created the demise shows that the lease was for a term of 20 years commencing from 01.01.1972. It is specifically mentioned that the lease is renewable and determinable as provided therein.\n\n34. As stated above, the principles in Green v. Palmer were later deviated by English Courts. They cannot be straight away applied discounting the facts of this case. Startling differences in facts in both the cases cannot be ignored. Although the contention raised by the plaintiff that as in the case\nof Lalji Tandon, a separate deed is required for renewal of the lease may not hold good in this case because in Lalji Tandon's case that was a stipulation borne out from the materials placed before the Supreme Court. And in this case, no such stipulation could be seen from Ext.A1. Having regard to the entire facts and circumstances under which the lease was made, purpose of the lease, original term of the lease agreed to by the parties, rate of rent, stipulations regarding the manner in which rent was agreed to be paid, etc., I am of the view that theory of automatic renewal of lease beyond a term of first renewal for 20 years cannot be read into the terms in Ext.A1. In otherwords, second\nrenewal of the lease cannot be said to be an automatic event and the concept of automatic renewal in the said clause can only be made applicable to the first renewal. Recalling the principles of interpretation of deeds discussed above, all the clauses in the document must be given effect to andthey should be harmoniously construed. Notwithstanding that law does not frown upon a permanent lease, there must be clear indications arising from the terms in the document to hold\nthat the lease in question was intended to be a permanent one. Applying the relevant principles mentioned above to the facts of this case, I am of the definite view that the lessee cannot claim a\nright to get a second renewal for another term of 20 years and clause I(h) conferred only a legal right on the lessee for one renewal after the expiry of the original term. Viewing from this angle, the courts below are legally justified in dismissing the claim of the defendants.",

From this, it cannot be concluded, as is sought to be\ndone by the learned counsel for the revenue that any payment made for use of\ntrademark or trade name ipso facto will give colour to the payment as if it is made on\ncapital account. This is in our view is a complete mis-reading of the judgment. It is\nwell settled that a judgment is an authority for what it decides and not what is\nconstrued as logically flowing from it. Judgments cannot be read as statutes. A stray\nsentence picked out of context, cannot be used to turn its ratio around. 22.3 We have\nalready referred to the provisions of the agreement.

The assessee acquired no right to any secret process or formulate or\neven any right title and interest in the trade marks and brands under which the IMFL\nproducts were sold.

When we consider all the relevant clauses of the trademark royalty Agreement, it becomes\nmanifest that the assessee did not acquire any ownership right in trademarks by paying the\nconsideration as set out therein. Such payment was made simply for the use of the trademarks, and\nthat too, by means of a non-exclusive License. It has been made clear in the Agreement that the\nownership in the trademarks shall remain the intellectual property of the Licensor and the assessee\nshall have a mere right to use them. Further, upon the termination, the Licensee shall cease to make\nany use of such trademarks. Thus, it is patent that the payment has been made by the assessee for\n'use of ' trademarks and not for acquiring trademarks as an owner. It goes without saying that any payment made for a mere use of an asset falls in the realm of a revenue expenditure and cannot be\ntreated as a capital expenditure. We, therefore, hold that whole of the payment of Rs.5.19 crore\nmade by the assessee for use of trade mark is a revenue expenditure.",

        "Extracts of discussion": "\n17. The assessee also appointed the Chartered Accountant to provide Valuation Report in order to\nwork out the fair market value of certain brands acquired by the assessee as part of the BPA. As per\nthe Valuation Report the purchase consideration totaling Rs.49.26 crores was allocated to the\nbrands and the tangible assets i.e. cost of building, plant &amp; machinery, furniture and fixtures,\nvehicles and net current assets. The balance purchase consideration of Rs.12.74 crores was shown\nunder the head 'goodwill'. The case of the assessee was that that the said balance consideration\nrepresents the value attributable to the intangible assets detailed in clause 2.2 and also as per the\nSchedule to the BPA and was recorded as goodwill in the books of account for the year under\nconsideration. The Assessing Officer had allowed the depreciation both on the brands and also on\nthe other tangible assets totaling Rs.49.26 crores. However, the depreciation on goodwill claimed by\nthe assessee was disallowed following the ratio laid down by the Hon'ble Bombay High Court in M/s\nTechno Shares &amp; Stocks [323 ITR 69 Bom)].\n\n30. The last objection of the authorities below and learned D.R. for the Revenue was that the Tax Auditors had denied benefit of depreciation on goodwill booked in the Balance Sheet. It is an established rule that the treatment of an entry in the books of account does not establish its allowability in the hands of the assessee. It is the nature of the expenditure which determines allowability of the expenditure in the hands of the assessee. The opinion of the auditors is not determinative of the correct position of law and while allowing the claim in the hands of the assessee, the authorities have to independently examine its allowability under the provisions of the Act and also as per the relevant judicial precedents. In view thereof, we direct the Assessing Officer to allow the claim of the assessee vis-à-vis depreciation with regard to claim of depreciation on intangible assets booked as goodwill in the books of account valued at Rs.12.74 crores. The grounds of appeal raised by the assessee in ITA No.293/Chd/2012 are thus allowed.\n\n\n38. The assessee claimed depreciation on the intangible assets acquired under the above said BAA\nand the same was disallowed by the Assessing Officer and the CIT (Appeals). We find that the facts\nof acquisition of allied business of M/s Wipro Ltd. and M/s Godrej Industries Ltd. are identical to\nthe facts of acquisition of allied business of Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. In line with our decision in\nITA No/293/Chd/2012 and the facts being identical our decision in ITA No.293/Chd/2012 would\nappl y mutatis mutandis to the facts in ITA No.294/Chd/2012. We have already directed the\nAssessing Officer to allow depreciation on goodwill of allied business of Ranbax y Laboratories Ltd.\nThe ground No.2 raised by the assessee in this regard is thus allowed.",

        "Extracts of discussion": "A suit for specific performance, being a suit for equitable relief, this Court has the duty to see what\nultimately is the justice of the case. The suit property, no doubt is jointly owned by Defendants 1 to\n8. But the agreement for sale was only by the Defendants 1 to 6. They not only excluded the sister\nand her husband but made two deliberate and wrong representations: that Defendants 1, 3 and 5 are\nthe only children of Late Vishwanta Purshotam Sinai Gaitonde and that the suit property was the\nonly estate left by their parents. The agreement for specific performance, no doubt, contained a\nclause that the sellers would make a good and marketable title of the property. Fully conscious of the\nfact that there was another heir namely the sister and that the property had already been mortgaged\nto the Cooperative Bank, a very significant clause was incorporated in the agreement to the effect\nthat the vendors could execute a proper conveyance in favour of the purchasers and in that regard,\nthe vendors would make any other person or persons to join them so as to convey an absolute title to\nthe purchaser or to redeem any charge or encumbrance. This clause clearly shows that the\nDefendants 1 to 6, though acted ill-advisedly by not joining the sister and her husband in the\nagreement and by not disclosing the mortgage, had still genuinely intended to execute the sale\ncovering both the eventualities namely, joining the sister and her husband and redeeming the\nmortgage (see Clause 6 of the Agreement of Sale extracted at pages 3-4).\n\nAt one stage, Defendants 1 to 8 apparently were sailing together, faced with the distress sale of the\nsuit property by the bank. It was in that context that the Defendants 1 to 6 made a request to the\nPlaintiff that in case the Plaintiff cleared the loan liability, they would get in the sister also for the\nconveyance of the property and settle the whole dispute. \n",

        "Extracts of discussion": "108. We may now turn to the provisions of the lease and the contentions in the context of\nSection(5)(8)(d). Undoubtedly, the lessee is put in possession of the land. Call it a right or a reward\nincidental to ownership, possession, or the right to possession has been transferred to the lessee.\nThe lessee is entitled to hold the plot. The lease further proclaims that the lessee shall use the\nallotted plot for the purpose indicated. Possession being in the context of a lease does not partake of\na liberty to not use as would be the case of an owner. In fact, the manner of the use is stipulated.\nNon-use even entails penalty and even cancellation. In fact, things could not be clearer when Clause\n13 under ‘other clauses’ is borne in mind. The said clause unequivocablly declares that the lessor in\nlarger public interest may take back the possession of the land/ building and making payment at the\nprevailing rate. This, no doubt, is subject to what we will pronounce on its impact on the fate of this\ncase.\n\n\n\n138. We are of the view that in the facts of the appeals before us, we are unable to hold that the\nlessee has raised any amounts from the appellant. The question, therefore, of considering the last\nlimb of Section 5(8)(f), namely, whether it has commercial effect of a borrowing could not arise. But\nwe can safely say that the obligation incurred by the lessee to pay the rental and the premium cannot\nbe treated as an amount raised by the lessee from the appellant. It may be noticed that it is\nreasonably possible to find that the lessee has raised this amount which it had to pay to the\nappellant from some other sources. The reliance on the concept of ‘a tool of raising finance’\ncanvassed by the appellants would be carrying things too far and to allow them to invoke it carries with-it far-reaching implications and bears dangerous portent for the purpose of Section 5(8)(f). We\nwould think that the concept of disbursement as present in the main provision appears to be\nmandatory in Section 5(8)(f). The purport of Section 5(8)(f) is to provide for an exhaustive catch-all\nprovision.\n\n141. We may notice that what Section 5(8)(d) of the IBC provides for is, any liability in respect of any\nlease, inter alia, which is, however, confined to a finance or capital lease. We are not ruling out the\npossibility that, in a lease, not a finance or a capital lease, falling under Section 5(8)(d), if it\notherwise fulfils the requirements of Section 5(8)(f), it would not fall under the definition of the\nword ‘financial debt’. In other words, Section 5(8)(d) includes only a finance or a capital lease, which\nis deemed, as such, under the Indian Accounting Standards. Section 5(8)(f) is a residuary and catch\nall provision. A lease, which is not a finance or a capital lease under Section 5(8)(d), may create a\nfinancial debt within the meaning of Section 5(8)(f), if, on its terms, the Court concludes that it is a\ntransaction, under which, any amount is raised, having the commercial effect of the borrowing. All\nthat we are finding, in the facts of this case, is that the lease in question does not fall within the\nambit of Section 5(8)(f). This is for the reason that the lessee has not raised any amount from the\nappellant under the lease, which is a transaction. The raising of the amount, which, according to the\nappellant, constitutes the financial debt, has not taken place in the form of any flow of funds from\nthe appellant/lessor, in any manner, to the lessee. The mere permission or facility of moratorium,\nfollowed by staggered payment in easy installments, cannot lead us to the conclusion that any\namount has been raised, under the lease, from the appellant, which is the most important\nconsideration.\n\n",

        "Extracts of discussion": "\n22. From the combined reading of clauses 5.2, 5.3, clause 17 relating to non competition clause and\nAnnexure A which can be said to be another set of the clauses contained in the Franchise\nAgreement, the following position emerges:\na) Firstly that all these clauses 5.2, clause 17 provides for the negative covenants and\nstate that the franchisee shall not operate, run or conduct or offer any services or\ncarry on or engage in or have any interest in franchised business as Schedule A. These\ntwo clauses while providing prohibitory nature of the acts clearly connects the\nfranchised business with that of Annexure A or Schedule A of the agreement.\nTherefore, there are clauses under the agreement wherein expression \"franchised business\" is either\nused as solely without reference to Annexure A like clause 2.1 relating to grant and other places\nunder the agreement. As against the same, there are clauses like 5.2, clause 17 which immediately\nconnects the acts and businesses defined under Annexure A/Schedule A under the agreement as theacts which the franchisee is prevented to do under the agreement or any similar competing business.\nThus, the annexure A/Schedule A has an inextricable nexus with that of the clauses contained in the\nagreement and thus cannot be totally severed from the agreement in order to give full effect to the\nclauses contained in the agreement.\n\n\nThe\nsaid business activities of Salon were in fact allowed by the plaintiff to be carried on by the\ndefendants between December, 2013 to December, 2014 or for that matter May 2015, when the\ndefendants discontinued using Salon business under the mark OZONE and on the contrary started\ndiverting the customers to its own Salon under the mark HAIR MASTERS by inducing the\ncustomers visiting the clubs to offer them discounts or asking them to go the defendants salon under\nthe mark Hair master during the subsistence of valid and subsisting arrangement between the\nplaintiff and defendants as franchisor and franchisee respectively under the franchised business.\nThus, the said acts of the defendants by forming a new company under the name Hair Masters Salon\nPrivate Limited in the month of May 2015 and thereafter proceeding to do the business of salon\nservices in neighbourhood in Punjabi Bagh and also creating misrepresentation by mixing up the\nfranchised business with that of the defendants' own business is clearly in violation of the clause 5.2\nwhich prohibits the defendants not to run or operate or offer any services described in Schedule A or\nwithin or outside the territory which is 4 kilometers from the specified location or outside. Further, the said business activities are also in violation of the non compete clause contained under clause\n17.1 which prohibits the defendants to carry on, own or engage in or have any interest in any other\nsimilar or competing franchised business as in schedule A during the term of the agreement. Prima\nfacie, the business activities of the defendants especially pursuant to forming of the company and\nproceeding to carry on their own business of Salon under the mark Hairmasters which is a\ncompeting business to that of the plaintiff and that to the detriment of the plaintiff and causing\nlosses to the plaintiff is in the breach of the express terms of the franchise agreement including the\nnon compete clause which is valid and subsisting.\n",

        "Contract clause": "1.7 \"FRANCHISED BUSINESS\" means the franchised business of Salon and Spa as per Annexure \"A\", to be run and operated by the Franchisee in accordance with the System and Standards under the Proprietary Marks of the Franchisor, and including the stock, sale, delivery or use of the Products if any, supplied in relation thereto by the Franchisor, as more particularly described in the Operating Manual.",
        "Extracts of discussion": "\n\n(emphasis is mine) 36.5 The record shows that, although, Ozone has asserted in paragraph 25 and\n35 of the plaint that it provided the necessary technical input for setting up the franchise business as\nalso the operation manual, requisite know-how, training to staff as well as details of\nvendors/suppliers, there is not a shred of evidence on record to back these averments. This becomes\nimportant given the complete denial of defendant no. 1 in her written statement concerning Ozone's\nassertion of having fulfilled its obligations under the FA. 36.6 When examined in the context of the\naforesaid discussion, the submission of Mr. Mehta that the FA casts an absolute liability to pay the\nfranchise fee/royalty is belied by the terms contained therein. Prima facie, the liability of defendant\nno. 1 to pay fixed franchise fee/royalty was dependent on Ozone fulfilling its initial and continuing\nobligations as etched in the FA.\n\n7.6 To provide to the Franchisee the details of the Products, Services and equipment\ndescribed in the Operating Manual on the terms from time to time herein specified\nand to assist the Franchisee in procuring such additional supplies of Products,\nServices and equipment as may be required by the Franchisee to commence and\noperate the Franchised Business and to use reasonable endeavours to negotiate and\nobtain from such suppliers favourable discount rates for furnishing such supplies to\nthe Franchisee at the cost of the Franchisee.\n\n\n",

        "Case name": "Diageo India P.Ltd, Mumbai vs Dcit Rg 6(2)(2), Mumbai on 25 August, 2022",
        "Contract clause": "Clause 2.2 of the Agreement deciphers the responsibility of the assessee in the Contract Territory Contract (India). Relevant parts of the clause are as under:-\"2.2. Responsibility in the Contract Territory BMW India represents the interests of BMW AG in the Contract Territory. It is responsible for the sales promotion and the full utilization of the market potential for the Contract Goods in the Contract Territory. ..... Furthermore, BMW India undertakes the following functions in the Contract Territory in accordance with the laws of the contracting territory. ........ Performance of an adequate advertisement and sales promotion as well as public and media relation. ........\"Clause 3 of the Agreement is also material for our purpose, which has been equally taken note of by the TPO as well in his order. Relevant parts of clause 3 read as under :-  \"3.1. Responsibilities for Sales and Advertising The BMW India will establish and supervise in the Contract Territory an efficient BMW distribution network for sales, service and parts supply according to the recommendations of BMW. To this end, BMW India will, in its own Page | 35 ITA no.1002&amp;2858/Mum/2016 Diageo India Private Limited; A.Y. 11-12 name, enter into dealer contracts in accordance with law of the Contracting Territory.\"",
        "Extracts of discussion": "6. On going through clause 2.2 of the Agreement, it becomes palpable that the assessee represented\nthe interest of BMW AG in India and is responsible for the sales promotion in India. Later part of\nthe clause stipulates that the assessee undertook certain functions in India, which include\n\"performance of an adequate advertisement and sales promotion as well as public and media\nrelations.\" Clause 3 of the Agreement refers to the responsibilities of the assessee for advertising. It\nprovides in no unambiguous terms that the assessee will meet its responsibility for the promotion of\nsales .... and undertook for applying its best efforts and adequate resources towards effective sales\npromotion and advertising Clause 3.6 of the Agreement stipulates that the assessee \"will establish\nand supervise ..... an efficient BMW distribution network for sales .... according to the\nrecommendations of BMW. A close scrutiny of the above clauses of the Agreement makes it\nabundantly clear that the assessee was assigned and it accepted the duty to perform advertisement\nand sales promotion and also assumed responsibility for deploying adequate resources towards\neffective sales promotion and advertisement of the goods in India. It is not a case where the assessee\non its own Page | 36 ITA no.1002&amp;2858/Mum/2016 Diageo India Private Limited; A.Y. 11-12\nvolition took up such a huge advertisement, marketing and promotion of the brand owned by its AE.\nIn fact, it was the `responsibility' of the assessee and it `undertook' the function of `performance of\nan adequate advertisement and sales promotion' pursuant to the Agreement dated 1.1.2006 with\nBMW AG. Thus it is apparent that the assessee was under a binding obligation to advertise and\npromote the brand of its AE.\n",

<div> Hi! I am a Law Graduate with an interest in <b> <i> LegalTech and Academic Research </i> </b> </div>

I am developing LegalTech solutions, with specific reference to <u> utilising FOSS and publishing Legal Datasets </u>. 
<br>

Some of my MVP’s in development are as follows:

Lex-liberalis, a form of “Semantra” for searching through Indian legal documents [click here to view](https://lex-liberalis.onrender.com/preview)
Schematise,  an LLM enabled XML generator for Indian laws in the Akoma Ntoso. [Click here to view](https://hasgeek.com/fifthelephant/open-source-ai-hackathon/sub/schematise-formerly-complianalyse-6tevdXfzxgEEynZ7P2hxX4)
I am currently working on “Indian Contracts in Adjudicated Texts” - an expert annotated sentiment analysis dataset for contract clause identification. [Click here to view](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1W1K7Q7zuIFjgxvUpYfT5KTv45lXq9ykr/view?usp=sharing)
<div> I am also  working independently on publishing academic research in the fields of Environmental Law, LegalOps, and Law and AI.</div>
